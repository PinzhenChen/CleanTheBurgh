Ms Cotton told Sky News: \u201cThey were in and out of that building, committing time after time to rescue the people we knew were in there. There was never any hesitation.

A lot of my firefighters yesterday experienced things they have never seen before. \u201cI spoke to some people who were truly distressed \u2013\u00a0not least because they knew there were people still in there and they were battling through the heat to get there. \u201cWhat happened yesterday truly traumatised a lot of people.\u201d The firefighters \u201cwere in fear for\u00a0their own lives\u201d\u00a0as they went into the building which was \u201calight from top to bottom\u201d, according to Ms Cotton. She said the firefighters had been particularly affected by the desperation of one family who threw a baby from a window in a bid to save it. She said: \u201cFor my crews who were on the ground who witnessed it happening it was truly horrible and shocking. \u201cI spoke to one of my officers who was very near when someone came out of the window, he was in tears. He is a professional fire officer. \u201cWe like to think of ourselves as roughty-tufty and as heroes but they have feelings. People were absolutely devastated by yesterday\u2019s events.\u201d  or register with your social account Already have an account?
