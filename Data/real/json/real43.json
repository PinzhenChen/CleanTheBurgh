Reza Aslan, host of CNN's\u00a0Believer TV, called the president a 'piece of s**t' after Trump used the London tragedy where three Jihadi terrorists killed seven people and injuring 30 more during a horrific knife rampage in central London last night as a means to try to reinforce America. The tweet from President Trump that sparked the 45-year-old journalist to respond said: 'We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!' After US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to use the London terrorist attack to reinforce his call for a United States Muslim travel ban, CNN host Reza Aslan\u00a0called the president a 'piece of s**t' The tweet from President Trump that sparked the 45-year-old journalist to respond said: 'We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!' 'This piece of s**t is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency. He's an embarrassment to humankind,' tweeted Aslan with Trump's tweet referenced 'This piece of s**t is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency. He's an embarrassment to humankind,' tweeted Aslan with Trump's tweet referenced. The reactions to the commentators tweet were more negative if anything with many upset that instead of focusing on the terrorist attack, that Aslan chose to focus on Trump. User @CarmineSabia pointed out the issue and said: 'The fact that you are more concerned about his words than terror attacks says a ton.' Many reactions to Aslan were negative.\u00a0User @CarmineSabia pointed out the issue and said: 'The fact that you are more concerned about his words than terror attacks says a ton' It was a criticism cosigned by @B_Y_E who tweeted: 'Glad you're more worried about him than the murders in London and Kabul' Blogger @MarkDice pointed out Aslan's eating history out by simply stating: 'You ate human brains bro. Human brains. On CNN' It was a criticism cosigned by @B_Y_E who tweeted: 'Glad you're more worried about him than the murders in London and Kabul.' Aslan is most recognizable for having come under heavy scrutiny after he ate part of a human brain while filming a segment on a Hindu sect in India as part of his show. Blogger @MarkDice pointed that out by simply stating: 'You ate human brains bro. Human brains. On CNN.'
