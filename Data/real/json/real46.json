{"text": "By PETER BAKER and JONATHAN WEISMANAUG. 31, 2013 American presidents generally want support from three places: Congress, the American people and allies abroad. In the case of a possible military strike in Syria, support may be in short supply. WASHINGTON \u2014  President Obama abruptly changed course on Saturday and postponed a military strike against the Syrian government in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack so he could seek authorization first from a deeply skeptical Congress. In one of the riskiest gambles of his presidency, Mr. Obama effectively dared lawmakers to either stand by him or, as he put it, allow President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to get away with murdering children with unconventional weapons. By asking them to take a stand, Mr. Obama tried to break out of the isolation of the last week as he confronted taking action without the support of the United Nations, Congress, the public or Britain, a usually reliable partner in such international operations. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to give that order,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a hurriedly organized appearance in the Rose Garden as American destroyers armed with Tomahawk missiles waited in the Mediterranean Sea. \u201cBut having made my decision as commander in chief based on what I am convinced is our national security interests, I\u2019m also mindful that I\u2019m the president of the world\u2019s oldest constitutional democracy.\u201d Although Congressional leaders hailed his decision to seek the permission of lawmakers who had been clamoring for a say, the turnabout leaves Mr. Obama at the political mercy of House Republicans, many of whom have opposed him at every turn and have already suggested that Syria\u2019s civil war does not pose a threat to the United States. His decision raises the possibility that he would be the first president in modern times to lose a vote on the use of force, much as Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain did in Parliament last week. Advertisement Mr. Obama overruled the advice of many of his aides who worried about just such a defeat, and Republican Congressional officials said Saturday that if a vote were taken immediately, the Republican-controlled House would not support action. Interviews with more than a dozen members of Congress made clear that the situation was volatile even in the Senate, where Democrats have a majority. \u201cObama hasn\u2019t got a chance to win this vote if he can\u2019t win the majority of his own party, and I doubt he can,\u201d Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a leading Republican, said in an interview. \u201cDemocrats have been conspicuously silent. Just about his only support is coming from Republicans. He is a war president without a war party.\u201d Advertisement Yet the debate may also put on display the divisions in the Republican Party between traditional national security hawks and a newer generation of lawmakers, particularly in the House, resistant to entanglements overseas and distrustful of Mr. Obama. \u201cIt will be an uphill battle for the president to convince me because I think he has handled this entire situation quite poorly,\u201d said Representative Tim Griffin, Republican of Arkansas. \u201cAnd frankly I am reluctant to give him a license for war when, with all due respect, I have little confidence he knows what he is doing.\u201d Even Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, two Republicans who have pressed Mr. Obama to intervene more aggressively in Syria, said Saturday that they might vote no because the president\u2019s plan was too limited. \u201cWe cannot in good conscience support isolated military strikes in Syria that are not part of an overall strategy that can change the momentum on the battlefield,\u201d they said in a statement. Against that backdrop, the wording of the authorization of force may be critical. White House officials drafted a proposed measure that tried to strike a balance between being too expansive and too restrictive, and sent it to Congress on Saturday evening. The proposal would empower Mr. Obama to order military action to \u201cprevent or deter the use or proliferation\u201d of chemical or biological weapons \u201cwithin, to or from Syria\u201d and to \u201cprotect the United States and its allies and partners against the threat posed by such weapons.\u201d Still, White House officials indicated that Mr. Obama might still authorize force even if Congress rejected it. As Syrian forces braced for attack, the president\u2019s decision effectively put it off for more than a week, since Congress is not due back in Washington until Sept. 9. Mr. Obama did not push for Congress to come back sooner, and House leaders opted to keep to their schedule. Senate leaders set committee hearings to begin on Tuesday with a floor vote \u201cno later\u201d than the week of\u00a0Sept. 9. Advertisement In the interim, lawmakers will be in their home states, where polls show their constituents are not eager to attack Syria. \u201cOne constituent said to me: \u2018It is horrendous that these children were killed, but they are being killed in other ways also. What\u2019s the difference?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said public opinion would pose a challenge for the president and Congress. \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if the position of going forward with the strike would reach 50 percent in our state,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would get to 50.\u201d  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The move also means that the period of vacillation before a strike will extend until after Mr. Obama travels to St. Petersburg, Russia, for a summit meeting of the Group of 20 nations, a session that now seems certain to be dominated by the question of what to do about Syria. President Vladimir V. Putin, the host of the meeting, not only has effectively blocked United Nations action, but on Saturday he suggested the chemical attack was a provocation by rebels intended to draw the United States into their war against Mr. Assad. Presidents in modern times have used military force both with and without Congressional authorization. George Bush and George W. Bush both won votes from lawmakers before wars with Iraq, and Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton launched strikes against Libya, Afghanistan and Kosovo without asking permission. Although Mr. Obama said as a candidate that a president has no power to launch a military attack except to stop \u201can actual or imminent threat to the nation,\u201d he acted unilaterally in Libya in 2011 and had no plans to act differently in Syria this time. But he found it much harder to proceed alone, given the British vote and polls showing that the vast majority of Americans want Congress to decide. Even allies like Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, one of Mr. Obama\u2019s earliest supporters for president and his handpicked Democratic Party chairman, publicly argued that he had to go to Congress for permission. \u201cThe worst thing we can do is put people out on that limb and ask them to potentially risk their lives based on equivocal political support,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. In making his request, Mr. Obama argued more forcefully than he ever had for military action against Syria, echoing some of the moral outrage expressed by Secretary of State John Kerry a day earlier. \u201cWhat message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?\u201d the president asked. Mr. Obama also dispatched Mr. Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and others to brief senators by telephone on Saturday and authorized a classified briefing on Capitol Hill on Sunday. Mr. Kerry was also booked on Sunday television news programs to make the case. Aaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East adviser to presidents, said Mr. Obama had made a persuasive case for action even as he jeopardized it. It \u201cshows just how concerned he is about being alone and his understanding of the realities that even a limited strike can be risky, and he wants to share the responsibility,\u201d he said. Advertisement A deeply divided Congress was already gearing up for bitter fights this fall over federal spending, the debt ceiling, immigration and government surveillance, and the surprise Syria vote will invite a complicated, multilayered debate crossing party lines and involving other actors like Israel supporters who worry that failure to follow through in Syria will embolden Iran. Many lawmakers welcomed the chance to vote. \u201cAt this point in the country\u2019s history, it\u2019s important that we have this debate, that we take this vote,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee. But some argued that Mr. Obama had blinked in the face of a tough choice and possible backlash, and abdicated responsibility. \u201cI strongly believe that the commander in chief has the absolute right to take military action,\u201d said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York. \u201cThe president seems like he\u2019s weak at every level.\u201d Jennifer Steinhauer and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.
