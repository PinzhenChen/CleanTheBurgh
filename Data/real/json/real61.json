{"text": "Middle East nations pledged cash to help women entrepreneurs as part of\u00a0global World Bank initiative Ivanka Trump has praised the progress of women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia after the country and the United Arab Emirates pledged to donate $100 million to the first\u00a0World Bank's global project for women entrepreneurs. Speaking in Saudi Arabia as her father met with Arab and Islam leaders, Ms Trump said progress in the nation was \u201cencouraging\u201d but said there was \u201cstill a lot of work to be done\u201d. \"In every country around the world women and girls continue to face unique systematic, institutional, cultural barriers, which hinder us from fully engaging in and achieving true parity of opportunity within our communities,\"\u00a0she said at a roundtable of women leaders in society, businesswomen and elected government officials. \u201dEach of you know this to be true. And yet the stories of Saudi women, such as yourselves, catalysing change, inspire me to believe in the possibility of global women\u2019s empowerment.\u201d Progress includes women being allowed to vote in local elections, and a decreasing amount of power held by the religious police. \u201cThe need to empower and engage women transcends borders and cultures. Whether in the United States or in Saudi Arabia, women play a critical role in a movement that unites us all,\u201d she said. Journalists were asked to leave the room before issues around women's equality\u00a0could be brought up, such as women not having the right to drive, go anywhere alone or be included in public life. US officials did not raise these concerns, as noted by the US state department\u2019s past reports on\u00a0human rights. Ms Trump was invited to participate by Saudi Princess Reema bint Bandar, a retail executive, divorced mother and social activist who is one of the main voices for women\u2019s rights in a conservative country. At the same forum, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said the UAE and Saudi Arabia will donate $100 million towards the planned $1 billion global women\u2019s entrepreneurship fund, which was encouraged by Ms Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. It is unclear how much each of the two Middle East nations donated. The Wall Street Journal reported that although the President's daughter proposed the fund, she does not control it or raise money for it. \u201cThank you @JimYongKim for your leadership & for joining me in a meaningful discussion with women entrepreneurs today,\u201d tweeted Ms Trump. He responded, \"Women\u2019s economic empowerment is key to growth. Thanks to Saudi Arabia & UAE for their support & @IvankaTrump for championing the issue.\" Ethnic Yemenis and supporters protest against President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily banning immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Yemen on February 2, 2017 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.
