{"text": "The United States President, Donald Trump has signed an executive order to allow all Pakistan nationals travel to the United States without visas. The new order, serving as a change in visa policy for Pakistanis traveling to the United States, would permit them stay in the U.S for a maximum period of 180 days for Tourism or Business purposes only. Stay over 180 days would therefore require a visa. Trump says this measure is to strengthen trade between the United States and Pakistan.
