{"text": "Posted By: Now8News A Los Angeles woman was arrested overnight after a failed attempt to perform a \u201cbeer run\u201d at the liquor Mart on N. 15th St. Juanita Ramirez, 35, entered the liquor store disguised in sunglasses and acting \u201cnervous,\u201d according to eyewitnesses. \u201cI immediately notice her body language when she entered the store,\u201d said Apu\u00a0Azaria, store owner. \u201cSo I followed her around by watching on our security cameras. I saw her take a six pack of beer in the bathroom and she came out empty-handed.\u201d That\u2019s when\u00a0Azaria confronted Ramirez and asked her if she left the six pack of beer in the bathroom. Ramirez denied the allegations and try to push past the store owner to exit the store. That\u2019s when\u00a0Azaria grabbed her by the arm and the struggle began. \u201cWhen I grabbed her she fell to the ground,\u201d said\u00a0Azaria. \u201cFoam and blood oozed out from under her skirt. I had no idea what was going on! Make a long story short, it was beer and her injuries from the shards of broken glass. I guess when she hit the ground she broke a bottle.\u201d When paramedics arrived they reportedly pulled five bottles of Heineken and one shattered bottle. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201d said Robert Gonzales, paramedic. \u201cWe rushed her to the hospital, where they performed emergency surgery to stitch up the internal lacerations.\u201d Ramirez is recovering in the hospital, but authorities say when she is released they will be booking her on charges of shoplifting. The store owner is pursuing charges. Posted By: Now8News ", "source": "now8news.com", "title": "Woman Arrested for Stealing a 6-Pack of Beer, Smuggling it Out in Her Vagina"}
