{"text": "Franklin Graham (Cornstalker)\nBy Beverly Gates Franklin Graham, son of famed preacher Billy Graham, has urged Christians to vote for thrice married, casino owner Donald Trump.  According to Graham, who feels Trump has been chosen by God, the reality TV star was the only thing standing between Christians and death camps. \u201cThe liberal Democrats are openly hostile to Christians,\u201d said Graham in an interview on WEHW radio. \u201cWe won\u2019t survive four more years of Democrat-led government. I can see them rounding Christians up and putting us in death camps unless we follow their laws that want to grant special rights to gays and transgender people.\u201d \u201cChristians need to vote for Trump, he embodies our values,\u201d said Graham. Apparently, many Evangelical Christians feel they are under siege. FOX News commentator Bill O\u2019Reilly has done several segments on the alleged \u201cWar on Christmas.\u201d Right Wing Watch reported Carl Gallups, an End Times preacher, told World Net Daily that the U.S. government was currently at war with Christians. \u201cIn my opinion, this particular election is right up there with the presidential elections before and during the Civil War,\u201d said Gallups. \u201cWe are in a kind of societal civil war right now! And we are certainly in a great spiritual civil war in our nation, perhaps one like never before.\u201d Sharing is caring!
