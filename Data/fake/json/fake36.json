{"text": " Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city\u2019s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years. As workers slung a strap around the statue\u2019s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags. \u201cThis historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,\u201d Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments. The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama. \u201cIt will be nice\u201d, Landrieu said, \u201cto see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.\u201d The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars. Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors. Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night. \u201cWe would have preferred it to be in the daytime,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cso everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.\u201d Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators \u2014 both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included \u201cWhere\u2019s Mitch?\u201d while opponents chanted, \u201cHey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.\u201d As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor\u2019s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.
