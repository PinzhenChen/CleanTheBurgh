{"text": "CINCINATTI,\u00c2\u00a0Ohio \u2013\u00c2 A 31-year old woman was admitted to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center yesterday after the 14-month old toddler\u00c2\u00a0she was babysitting\u00c2\u00a0got stuck in her vaginal cavity. Latifah Brown reportedly called 911 and told the operator\u00c2\u00a0that she had \u201ca baby stuck in her vagina.\u201d The operator dispatched an ambulance with the report that a woman was having a home birth. The paramedics who were dispatched say they were surprised when they arrived to the home\u00c2\u00a0and saw what was actually happening. Brian Whitmore, the lead paramedic on the scene, related the incident\u00c2\u00a0in an interview with WCNN News8Now: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe little boy wore a diaper and pyjamas, but he had his legs and abdomen stuck up inside the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vagina. It was horrifying and hilarious. Horrifying because the baby was screaming, but hilarious that this woman had a toddler hanging out of her cooter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The paramedics tried to release the child while still in the home, but Brown\u2019s vagina was reportedly \u201ctoo clenched,\u201d and the pair were taken to a local hospital, where doctors spent nearly two hours surgically removing the child from Brown\u2019s vagina.\u00c2\u00a0Dr. Gene Larkin, who performed the surgery, was also interviewed by WCNN: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how she got the child in there!\u00c2\u00a0We tried pulling him out, but it didn\u2019t work. It appeared that Brown\u2019s vagina, not use to anything being inserted into it, had clenched down on the poor baby to the point that we literally had to use the Jaws of Life to get him out. According to the doctors, Brown\u2019s vagina has been \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d by the act, and they are doubtful that any number of surgeries could fix the damage.\u00c2\u00a0The young boy suffers from a dislocated hip, but doctors say that because of his age, he should not see any long-term effects. Brown\u00c2\u00a0was interrogated by police, and eventually confessed to deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity, because she was barren, and just wanted to know what it would feel like to \u201cgive birth.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Brown faces a total of 11\u00c2\u00a0criminal charges, including aggravated child neglect causing\u00c2\u00a0bodily harm, and faces\u00c2\u00a0up to\u00c2\u00a065 years in prison if convicted.\n\n\n|Tweet\n|Like0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments comments comments Posted on May 28, 2017 by Bob The Empire News Potato Bob The Empire News Potato 0  | | 0 | | 0 Posted in Weird News", "source": "empirenews.net", "title": "Babysitter Facing 65 Years in Prison For Inserting Toddler Into Her Vagina"}
