Pence named the former vice president, who served under George W. Bush, as his role model for the No. 2 spot in the White House. \u201cI frankly hold Dick Cheney in really high regard in his role as vice president and as an American,\u201d Pence said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Pence praised Cheney for being \u201cvery active\u201d in working with the House and Senate. Cheney left office in 2009 with a 13 percent approval rating. However, the controversial governor of Indiana didn\u2019t stop there. He also mentioned former half-term Alaska governor Sarah Palin as another example of people he admires. Only, when it comes to Palin, that admiration has to do with something else. \u201cOne of the great things about being American is I get to live in this great and beautiful country and help make it great again, because it can be and it has the potential for it. And I also can\u2019t shy away from noticing how beautiful our women can be. It\u2019s truly a blessing to be an American today,\u201d he said. \u201cTake Sarah Palin, for example,\u201d Pence argued. \u201cEven though she\u2019s married and I have the utmost respect for her husband, I can\u2019t help but notice that she embodies everything an American woman should be and that just makes me very happy.\u201d He added, \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, she\u2019s smart, she\u2019s educated, she\u2019s a mother, she stands up for what she believes in, she\u2019s doing an important job and most of all, she\u2019s had a taste of political power and handled it beautifully. She\u2019s ideal.\u201d Pence continued, \u201cIn a certain way, I\u2019m proud to call her my role model when it comes to what American women should be like. But unfortunately, today we have numerous examples of the opposite. One of those examples includes Hillary Clinton, who just couldn\u2019t leave enough alone, could she? She already had the First Lady position; she saw the inside of the White House and had a lot of fun in it for 8 years. She should have been happy and be done with it, but no. She had to go out and support feminism and then run for the Senate and the Presidency. And that\u2019s not what modern American women should go after. Not at all.\u201d Pence also argued that, \u201cwith all due respect,\u201d Hillary Clinton \u201clooks like someone took a leprechaun, put make up on it, and told him to accept money from whomever it wants if that gets him the presidency.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s not an insult because it\u2019s the truth, and you can ask anyone you want and they\u2019ll agree with me,\u201d Pence added. \u201cBecause, let\u2019s face it: the most defining characteristic of a woman is her beauty. And Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have it. Beauty in general, I mean, not just female beauty.\u201d \u201cNow, Sarah Palin, well, she\u2019s the spitting image of what a beautiful, smart, confident woman should look like,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has several children, meaning she\u2019s a good mother, she still manages to be drop-dead gorgeous whenever she appears on TV, and she still acts as the voice of reason when it comes to politics in the United States. I don\u2019t want anybody to get the wrong impression based on what I\u2019ve just said, but if I wasn\u2019t married, you know I\u2019d tap that,\u201d Pence concluded.
