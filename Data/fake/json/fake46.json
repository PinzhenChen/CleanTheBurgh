{"text": "CEBU CITY, Philippines \u2013 Vice presidential candidate and Camarines Sur 3rd district Representative Leni Robredo said that it would be difficult to work with presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte, the current survey front-runner for president, if he should win. \u201cI accepted the Liberal Party\u2019s vice presidential nomination because I was assured by President Aquino that Mar Roxas and myself will win as a tandem \u2014 as president and vice president, respectively.\u201d \u201cDuterte and I are the exact opposites and I don\u2019t see working with him even remotely possible.\u201d With those words, Robredo said that if Duterte becomes president and she is elected vice president, she would resign from her post on the first day in office. What happens if the office of the vice president is vacant? According to the 1987 constitution, the next in line to the vice president is the president of the Senate, followed by the speaker of the House of Representatives. The only way Senator Bongbong Marcos or any of the vice presidential losers can succeed Robredo is for them to become Senate president. All the vice presidential contenders, except Robredo, are incumbent senators.
