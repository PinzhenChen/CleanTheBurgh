{"text": "Jennifer Burrows,\u00a0an assistant pathologist with the Jackson County medical examiner services, is accused of having sex with\u00a0dozens of\u00a0corpses over the course of the\u00a0last two years, a behavior which\u00a0led the birth of a baby boy on January 7. According to the Kansas City Missouri Police Department, her baby is the son of man who died in a car accident in March 2015, and whose body she was supposed to autopsy. They\u00a0allege that she Ms. Burrows sexually abused more than 60 other dead bodies, belonging to males from 17 to 71 years old. \u201cWe opened an investigation\u00a0about this case in October after we were informed that the suspect may have been sexually abusing corpses,\u201d Police Chief Fort\u00e9 told reporters. \u201cWe accumulated enough evidence over the last few months to obtain\u00a0a warrant for a paternity test on her newborn son. It\u00a0confirmed our suspicions,\u00a0that the father of her child was, indeed, a 57-year old veterinarian from Texas who was driving through the county when he had a fatal car accident. All the evidence that we\u00a0have gathered suggests that he had never met Ms. Burrows before his demise and that he was\u00a0already dead when the baby was conceived.\u201d The KCMO Police Chief, Darryl Fort\u00e9, briefly commented Ms. Burrows\u2019 arrest this morning during a press conference, calling it \u201cone of the most sordid case he has seen in his career\u201d. There are currently no laws (state or federal) governing or explicitly outlawing the practice of necrophilia, since the corpse is considered human remains and no longer living. Therefore, it is technically legal in the state of Missouri, and\u00a0Ms Burrows\u2019 actions are judged as\u00a0an\u00a0indecent treatment of a corpse. She is facing a total of 158 charges, including indecent treatment of a corpse, disorderly conduct, indecent exposure and possession of illegal drugs. The psychologists and experts that we interviewed were divided in their interpretation of Ms Burrows\u2019 case. Some, Like Professor Isabella Ramirez of the University of Missouri, believe that the young woman was suffering from a psychosis and had, at least\u00a0partially, lost contact with reality. Others, like Dr Gerald Porter, a well-known psychologist and expert in sexual disorders associated with the\u00a0Institute of Psychological Sciences, believe that the accused is clearly a compulsive necrophiliac, and that her choice of profession\u00a0was inspired by\u00a0her sexual deviation in the first place. All seem to agree, however, that the 26-year old woman was suffering from mental problems and that she will probably register a plea of insanity.
