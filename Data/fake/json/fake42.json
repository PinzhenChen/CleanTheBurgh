{"text": "DAVE WEASEL NEW YORK \u2013 A 41-year-old woman had the winning lottery ticket worth over 3 million dollars on Friday night, but showed up to work anyway on Monday to deliver one last package.  The courier company had no idea of her winnings. \u201cI knew something was wrong because I came back from lunch and the door to my office was closed,\u201d said the manager. I slowly opened the door to discover the woman with her pants around her ankles, hunched over on my desk like a hippopotamus/cheetah dropping a massive poo on my desk. She shot her head towards me and locked eyes. I was frozen in shock and fear. In my peripheral vision I saw a huge mud-monkey sliming out of her butt like a Play-Doh fun factory.\u201d \u201cIt was worth it,\u201d the woman said on arrest. \u201cOn Friday when I realized I hit the lotto, I knew this would be the first thing I would do. I hit up every Mexican food truck and saved my dumps all weekend. I was shuffling around like a death-row inmate trying not to explode.\u00a0I\u2019ve been putting up with that guy\u2019s shit for years, it\u2019s time he put up with some of mine.\u201d Follow the author on \u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram writer | comedian | musician | canadian | etc No god no noooooooooo No matter how you look at it love your boss or hate them.

Many years ago in Albuquerque my husband had a girlfriend who worked at a restaurant in a motel on rte66. The owner was Iranian and they both worked at the motel, which had two stories and sixty rooms. The owner kept making passes at her and refused to pay her unless she gave in to him. So she quit and they moved out, but not before he half-filled a white plastic potato salad bucket and hid it deep in the bowels of the central Aircon system, which vented the smell of shit into every room, including the front office. The owners were unable to locate the source of the aroma, the business failed, and no one wanted to buy the property. So the story here could be true. Monkey shit sheeple satire garbage. Only RETARDS Believe these IDIOT\u2013CAUSING/BREEDING CANCER \u201carticles! \u2026but please tell us what you REALLY think? Yeah, this story is fake.
