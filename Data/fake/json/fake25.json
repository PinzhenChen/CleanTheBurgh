{"text": " NEW YORK CITY, New York \u2013\u00c2 A vicious schoolyard fight took place after school on Friday afternoon, and terrorist group ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attacks. Nicky DeCarlo, 7, was reportedly attacked by a \u201cbig bully,\u201d during lunch recess, and tattled to his teacher. When the bully, 9-year-old Al Giovannelli, found out he was in trouble, he told DeCarlo that they were going to \u201cfight after school.\u201d \u201cIt is really such a common thing, kids fighting and bullying and what not, but at this age, we tend to just call the parents, try a little mediation, maybe keep them in from recess, and everything is okay,\u201d said Principal Stephanie Biro. \u201cIn this case, the kids were actually\u00c2\u00a0fine by the next day. They quickly became friends after the fight, and Little Al even said he was sorry for punching Nicky in the face. It\u2019s pretty common with kids to \u2018hate,\u2019 and then feel bad. The real confusion here comes with why ISIS has claimed responsibility for the fight.\u201d According to police, ISIS stepped in and said that they were responsible for the altercation, and made several posts on social media stating they were the perpetrators. \u201cAl is definitely not in ISIS,\u201d said his mom to local news channel WBTU \u2013 New York. \u201cI know that any time there is a big attack, anywhere in the world, these terrorists like to claim responsibility, but this is just getting silly. We\u2019re not in ISIS. Albert doesn\u2019t even know what ISIS is. They\u2019re really reaching here.\u201d \u201cWE HAVE CLAIMED THE SCHOOL YARDS OF AMERICA, WE HAVE CAUSED THESE FIGHTS. THIS IS OUR TIME, AND ALL INFIDELS WILL REAP WHAT THEY HAVE CREATED,\u201d read a post made to Twitter from an \u201cofficial\u201d ISIS account. \u201cWE HAVE CAUSED THIS FIGHT TODAY. ALL CHILDREN WILL BECOME MEMBERS SOON.\u201d Police are not at all taking the statement\u00c2\u00a0seriously.\n\n\n|Tweet\n|Like0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments comments comments Posted on June 5, 2017 by Bob The Empire News Potato Bob The Empire News Potato 0  | | 0 | | 0 Posted in Headlines Tagged bullying, Fight, ISIS, school yard, Schools", "source": "empirenews.net", "title": "ISIS Claims Responsibility For Playground Fight at NYC Elementary School"}
