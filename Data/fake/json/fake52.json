{"text": "In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Rupaul\u00a0said that Mr Trump \u201cmade a move\u201d on him during an event celebrating the release of the movie\u00a0To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. The artist was wearing his full drag queen apparel at the time, and he says Trump clearly mistook him for a real woman. Rupaul says he was dressed \u201cvery sexy\u201d for the party and is convinced that Trump thought he was a woman. Rupaul says he found Donald\u00a0Trump attractive before this incident, but that he was shocked by his rudeness and vulgarity. Rupaul told the\u00a0Hollywood Inquirer that Donald Trump moved on him during a party, grabbing his ass and genitals. This allegation from Rupaul adds to the wave of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior concerning Donald Trump. Many women have come forward over the last week to denounce\u00a0the abusive\u00a0groping and sexual harassment they suffered from Trump over the years. The New York Times published an article earlier this week, in which Trumps\u2019s alleged victims described the mistreatment they suffered. All these\u00a0allegations came after Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings from 2005 obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News. The comments were part of a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d The remarks were captured by a live microphone that Trump did not appear to know was recording their conversation. He added: \u201cGrab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201d In Rupaul\u2019s case, Trump seems to have been disappointed by what he discovered under the dress.
