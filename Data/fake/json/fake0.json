{"text": " AUGUSTA, Georgia\u00c2\u00a0\u2013 Joel Fine, 32, was arrested on Friday evening after police say that he went into his place of employment and defecated on the desk of his boss, Mark Carson, at Excess Communications, a telecommunications\u00c2\u00a0company. Fine won a $6.7 million dollar lottery jackpot on Wednesday evening, and said that he waited until Friday to visit his employer, because he had \u201ca present\u201d for his former boss. \u201cI worked at Excess for nearly 5 years, and that sonofabitch rode me every single day, all day, with never a single solitary \u2018thank you\u2019 or any expression of gratitude of a job well done,\u201d said Fine. \u201cThe guy went through the same training program as me, and moved up only because his uncle was the former manager, and when he quit, nepotism reared its ugly head.\u201d Fine says that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it\u201d when he won the lottery, but almost as good as being able to never work again, was knowing that he would be able to finally \u201cafford\u201d the present he always wanted to deliver to Carson. \u201cI walked into my office on Friday, even though I wasn\u2019t supposed to be there that day, and I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes,\u201d said Carson. \u201cJoel was crouched on top of my desk, pants around his ankles, and he was reading a newspaper. A big, steaming pile of shit was all over my monthly reports. When he saw me, he just smiled, and told me to \u2018kiss his ass.'\u201d Carson called the police, and Fine was arrested for indecent exposure and criminal mischief. He was released on $2,000 bail, which he called \u201cchump change\u201d and \u201ctotally well worth it.\u201d\n\n\n|Tweet\n|Like0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments comments comments Posted on May 15, 2016 by Bob The Empire News Potato Bob The Empire News Potato 0  | | 0 | | 0 Posted in Uncategorized Tagged Arrested, boss, defecate, desk, lottery, man, Woman", "source": "empirenews.net", "title": "Man Arrested For Defecating On Boss\u2019 Desk After Winning State Lottery"}
