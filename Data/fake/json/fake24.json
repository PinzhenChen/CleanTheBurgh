{"text": "Posted By: Now8News NEWS 8 \u2013 \u00a0As China does away with its \u2018One Child Law\u2019, Donald Trump proposes to bring this law to the United States imposing stiff consequences to the Hispanic population if they do not comply. Trump states that bringing this law to the US would help control the growing Hispanic population that is coming into this country. \u201cBuilding a fence is not enough,\u201d Donald Trump said during speech. \u201cOnce they get to the US, which they will, legally or illegally, they will begin populating this country with large amounts of children. The American people, who have put their blood, sweat, and tears into this country, are not okay with that. I am proposing a one child law for Hispanics immediately at the beginning of my term \u2013 let\u2019s make America great again!\u201d If Trump gets his way, the law that he is proposing would go into effect for Hispanics on visas, Hispanics applying for citizenship, and undocumented Hispanics. Hispanic families who received citizenship prior to 2016 would not be affected by this new law. If a pregnancy results in the birth of twins, then two children will be permitted. The government will provide free medical services for tubal ligation\u2019s and vasectomies\u00a0immediately following the birth of their first child, if Donald Trump\u2019s law goes into effect. Any Hispanic family wishing to relocate to the United States with more than one child, will have to leave the other children in their home country \u2013 forcing families to choose their favorite child to bring with them. The ACLU released a statement saying, \u201cWe will fight against this discriminatory law with everything we have. This is not China, nor is this the Hitler Regime. This is the United States of America \u2013 we will continue to fight for the rights of all Hispanic people.\u201d Posted By: Now8News ", "source": "now8news.com", "title": "Donald Trump Proposes \u2018One Child Law\u2019 For Hispanics"}
