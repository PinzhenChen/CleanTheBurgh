{"text": "by Chris Reynolds  June 7, 2017 8:06 am0 It is customary for outgoing U.S. Presidents to depart from Washington, D.C. following the completion of their tenure in the White House, to not interfere with our country\u2019s democratic process and give the current President as much space as they need to try and carry out their own agenda. Unfortunately, former President Barack Hussein Obama has flagrantly violated this norm, and still lives in Washington, D.C. just a short drive away from the White House. What\u2019s more, Obama has been using his abundant free time to rile up his liberal followers and attempt to actively undermine President Donald Trump. Obama was at it again in the wake of President Trump\u2019s bold decision to withdraw the United States from the leftist climate change agreement that Obama committed our country to while he was in the White House. Upset that Trump was putting America and spoiling his agenda, egomaniac Obama put out a statement criticizing Trump\u2019s decision. Said Obama, \u201cThe nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I\u2019m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do ever more to lead the way.\u201d In this statement, Obama neglected to mention the fact that he made this agreement without consulting Congress. He added,\u00a0\u201cA year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world we leave to our children. It was steady, principled American leadership on the world stage that made this achievement possible. It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher as well. And what made that leadership and ambition possible was America\u2019s private innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar\u2014industries that created some of the fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in recent years, and contributed to the longest streak of job creation in our history.\u201d Unfortunately for Obama, Trump thoroughly ignored Barack\u2019s statement, and the former President just came off like a meddler with dwindling relevance. Are you glad that Trump dismissed Obama\u2019s bitter statement?
