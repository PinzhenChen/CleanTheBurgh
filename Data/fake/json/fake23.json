{"text": "Posted By: Now8News Danielle Bregoli, 13, was found dead in an alleyway at 5:13 am EST, covered in trash, just hours after her mother reported her missing to Boynton Beach police. Detectives say\u00a0Bregoli\u2019s body was burned with a symbol, possibly connected to Russian thugs in the area. Earlier this week, a self righteous group of hackers seized Danielle Bregoli\u2019s social media accounts disgusted of her glorified attitude.\u00a0\u201cFace Security Group,\u201d the hacking entity that claims to have taken over Bregoli\u2019s Instagram page, changed her name and profile picture and posted 3 videos to her account. The group threatened that they would begin unspecified \u201cleaks\u201d Wednesday evening, the exact time that\u00a0Bregoli was reported missing. This terrible tragedy occurred just as\u00a0Bregoli\u2019s father was seeking to gain custody of his daughter claiming \u201cparental alienation.\u201d Bregoli became famous when she appeared on Dr. Phil, for a segment called \u201cI Want to Give Up My Car-Stealing, Knife-Wielding, Twerking 13-Year-Old Daughter Who Tried to Frame Me for a Crime.\u201d It was pretty standard Dr. Phil fare until the 13-year-old uttered her immortal line, which is now officially spelled: \u201cCash me outside, howbow dah?\u201d Dr. Phil looked bemused, and her mom had to explain that the phrase \u201cmeans she\u2019ll go outside and do what she has to do.\u201d Danielle Bregoli is dead at the young age of 13. Service date and location to be announced next week. Posted By: Now8News ", "source": "now8news.com", "title": "\u2018Cash Me Outside Girl\u2019 Found Dead, Possible Russian Hacking Connection"}
