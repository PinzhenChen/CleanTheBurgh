{"text": " BANGOR, Maine \u2013\u00c2 Mary Lambert is suing her daughter\u2019s school, Bangor High School in Bangor, Maine, after a cafeteria woman made her cry by explaining she could only have \u201cone free lunch\u201d a day. Amanda Lambert, 16, gets free lunch at the school due to her mother\u2019s income, but the rules stipulate that she can only have one free meal a day. \u201cIt\u2019s unheard of that Amanda should not be allowed to eat as much as she wants,\u201d said Mary Lambert, 50. \u201cShe\u2019s a growing girl, and she needs nutrients. I\u2019m not able to afford good food at home, and the school should be letting her pig out while she\u2019s there. They know I\u2019m poor, that\u2019s why she gets free lunch. Why are they stopping her from eating.\u201d The school says that it doesn\u2019t matter who the student is, they are on a budget, and students only get one meal a day. \u201cI understand that Amanda is fat,\u201d said Bangor principal Joyce Mellows. \u201cLike, abnormally fat for a 16-year-old. Perhaps she should be going outside for a walk at lunch, instead of trying to feed her fatty fat fat fat face with extra lunches. Other kids want to eat, too.\u201d Lambert brought a suit against the school alleging discrimination for not allowing Amanda to eat as much food as she wanted, stating it was because Amanda\u2019s family was \u201ctoo poor\u201d to afford food that they were being denied food all together. A lawyer for the school said the case is \u201cstupid,\u201d and something that \u201conly a truly fat individual\u201d could ever come up with.\n\n\n|Tweet\n|Like0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments comments comments Posted on May 26, 2017 by Bob The Empire News Potato Bob The Empire News Potato 0  | | 0 | | 0 Posted in Health/Fitness, Law Tagged fat, food, Lawsuit, school lunch, welfare", "source": "empirenews.net", "title": "Mom on Welfare Sues School After Being Told Her Daughter Can Only Get ONE Free Lunch a Day"}
