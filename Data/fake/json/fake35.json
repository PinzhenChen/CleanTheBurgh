It\u2019s apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement but the fact is the F.B.I. has been in possession of Rich\u2019s laptop and the agency\u2019s director at the time, James Comey locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC, or members of Hillary\u2019s campaign team, or Hillary Clinton, or likely all three. Comey\u2019s contention that the DNC server contained proof that Russia hackers affected the election is falling apart as we watch the mad scramble that is ensuing following the recent ransomware attacks. In explained the ransomware attack, experts are shooting holes in Comey\u2019s claim that the F.B.I. is capable of tracking attacks backwards. Hector Monsegur, Director of Security Assessments for Rhino Security Labs and a former computer hacker who had been arrested by the FBI informant before turning informant said: \u201cAttribution is probably the hardest thing the FBI is dealing with here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nearly impossible because you have various hackers from pretty much anywhere.
