{"text": " LYNN, Massachusetts \u2013\u00c2 Seventeen pre-teens, aged 11-15, are dead after a massive fight broke out at a Lynn, Massachusetts middle school over the latest craze, fidget spinners. According to police, several children began arguing about whose fidget spinner was \u201cthe best,\u201d and several others began pestering the first group for being \u201csuper gay,\u201d and having fidget spinners in the first place. \u201cBefore you knew it, we had 60 or 70 kids just attacking each other,\u201d said Darlene McDonald, a 7th grade teacher at Lynn Middle School. \u201cFidget spinners were being thrown everywhere \u2013 I saw one kid take his fidget spinner between his fingers like a pair of brass knuckles, and beat another student in the face repeatedly until one of his eyes simply popped out of his head. It was gruesome, and the most disturbing thing I\u2019ve ever seen. But if they think I\u2019m getting involved in this shit at $14 bucks an hour, they can get real.\u201d Police were called to break up the melee, but by the time they arrived, 13 students had died, and another 24 were injured. Another 4 died later on due to sustained injuries. \u201cWe had tried to ban fidget spinners in the school, but the parents, they lobbied to bring them back,\u201d said Principal Grace Marlins. \u201cSo we let them play, knowing full well the dangers. I cannot believe that something like this happened over a $1 piece of plastic. Sad thing is, the parents still won\u2019t let us ban them \u2013 they just want everything monitored better. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d Fidget spinners are quickly become a problem in many classrooms throughout the country, with teachers calling them a \u201cdistraction\u201d and a \u201ctime waster.\u201d \u201cThis just proves how dangerous they really are, though,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cWe went through a lot of phases in my days as a teacher \u2013 slap bracelets, pogs, and then cell phones, of course. But this is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen kids beat each other to death over a fad. This world has gone truly crazy.\u201d\n\n\n|Tweet\n|Like0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments comments comments Posted on May 24, 2017 by Bob The Empire News Potato Bob The Empire News Potato 0  | | 0 | | 0 Posted in Weird News Tagged death, fidget spinners, Fight, high school, teens", "source": "empirenews.net", "title": "17 Children Are DEAD After a Fight Breaks Out in Middle School Over Fidget Spinners"}
