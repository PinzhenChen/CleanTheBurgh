According to immunologists, obese Americans who received the flu shot showed a bigger risk in developing the flu than the rest of the unvaccinated population. Lewrockwell.com reports: A striking study shows flu vaccination did increase antibody titers (concentration) among healthy and obese individuals, but that failed to protect obese individuals from the flu.\u00a0 In fact, obese vaccinated individuals were twice as likely to get the flu compared to healthy vaccinated individuals.\u00a0 Given over 100 million Americans elect to get a flu shot annually and a third of the adult population is obese, vaccination programs appear to be counterproductive. [Daily Mail June 7, 2017] Immunologists identified an impaired T-cell response as the cause of the problem.\u00a0 The study was published in the International Journal of Obesity. \u201cThis finding challenges the current standard blood tests being used to indicate whether a person has enough protection against influenza or not,\u201d said a commentary by the publisher of the study. The lead researcher for the study said: \u201cAlternative approaches may be needed to protect obese adults from both seasonal and pandemic influenza virus infections.\u201d A paper published in the journal Medical Hypotheses in 1999 suggests such an alternative.\u00a0 Deficiencies of zinc, a trace mineral, and glutathione (glu-ta-thy-on), an internally produced enzymatic antioxidant, as well as nitric oxide, a transient arterial gas, can lead to an impaired cellular immune response. Nitric oxide is activated with the consumption of amino acids (arginine, citrulline), resveratrol and garlic.\u00a0 Glutathione is a sulfur-bearing antioxidant that is activated by vitamin C and resveratrol. Provision of supplemental vitamins A, B6, C, E, zinc and selenium are proposed to rectify the abnormal T-cell response.\u00a0 Zinc also serves as a mimic of insulin among diabetics who are likely overweight and prone to weak immunity. Nitric oxide and the trace mineral selenium help to release zinc from a binding protein (metallothionein) that inhibits its bioavailability.
