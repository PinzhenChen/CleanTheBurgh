{"text": "Posted By: Now8News Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night, reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina. The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site. The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening. One of the paramedics, Brian Whitmore, related the incident\u00a0in an interview with\u00a0WBNS-10 TV. The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out. Ms. Brown and the child were finally\u00a0transported\u00a0to the hospital, where doctors were able to separate them after a delicate operation. The young boy suffers from a dislocated hip, but doctors don\u2019t think he will suffer any sequelae from the incident. The babysitter was interrogated by police\u00a0and confessed to deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity. She explained that she was feeling depressed after\u00a0her doctor told her she could never have children\u00a0and wanted to know how it felt to give birth. Ms. Brown now\u00a0faces a total of 11\u00a0criminal charges, including aggravated child neglect causing\u00a0bodily harm, and could spend up to\u00a065 years in prison. Her lawyer has asked for a psychiatric evaluation, claiming that she isn\u2019t fit to stand trial. Depending on the results of the evaluation, her trial could begin in June.
