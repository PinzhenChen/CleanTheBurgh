{"text": " FLINT, Michigan \u2013\u00c2 Residents of Flint, Michigan have begun having been having their water imported from other states for quite some time, as the situation of their own water has been disasterous. But now, some residents have begun looking even further away, and are having their water imported from across the border in Tijuana. \u201cOur water is so bad, that Mexican tap water looks like crystal-clear spring water in comparison,\u201d said Flint resident Mario Jones. \u201cI can get about 50 gallons of Mexican tap water for about $5, which is a lot cheaper than here. Sure, it still gives me the shits, but that\u2019s par for the course now. At least it doesn\u2019t look like sewage.\u201d Mexico has been grateful for the business, with several companies across the border saying that they thought they would NEVER have use for tap water. \u201cOur water, it was muy disgustingo,\u201d said Pedro Martinez. \u201cBut when I heard about the hydro crisis in Flint, I thought it was a good idea to start up a new company, and get them the water that they need. So I fill up about 200 gallon bottles a week, and I drive them into Arizona, where it can be shipped much cheaper. It\u2019s a great deal for me. My family has lots of extra pesos now.\u201d\n\n\n|Tweet\n|Like0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments comments comments Posted on April 29, 2017 by Bob The Empire News Potato Bob The Empire News Potato 0  | | 0 | | 0 Posted in Business, Health/Fitness Tagged flint, mexico, Michigan, tijuana, water", "source": "empirenews.net", "title": "Flint, Michigan Begins Having Tap Water Imported From Mexico"}
