{"text": "Posted on June 7, 2017   ( Fox News ) The controversial practice of having \u201cghost teachers\u201d in public schools is haunting another Pennsylvania school district. A lawsuit was recently filed against the Reading School District in eastern Pennsylvania, alleging that so-called ghost teachers have been paid more than $500,000, essentially to skip teaching classes and instead work full time for the local teachers\u2019 union, the Reading Education Association (REA). Under current state law, a collective bargaining agreement between a union and a school district can require the district to allow teachers to work full time for the union while still drawing a teacher\u2019s salary and benefits. Such ghost teachers are also paid by their union. The lawsuit\u2019s plaintiff, Americans for Fair Treatment (AFT), is seeking to end the practice of ghost teaching in Reading. The group claims tax dollars are illegally being given to members of the REA. The AFT filed the lawsuit with assistance from the Fairness Center, a watchdog group. \u201cI think this has been off people\u2019s radars for a while,\u201d Karin Sweigart, the AFT\u2019s deputy general counsel, said to Fox News. \u201cUnless taxpayers were specific in requesting information on where their money was being allocated, they would not know about these salaries for ghost teachers.\u201d  This entry was posted in NEWS and tagged ghost teachers, lawsuit, Pennsylvania, Reading Education Association, Reading School District, teachers union.
