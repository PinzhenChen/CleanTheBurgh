{"text": "June 6, 2017\nBaxter Dmitry\nNews, World\n9 Video footage has surfaced of Sadiq Khan, London\u2019s Muslim mayor, defending a 9/11 conspirator, and arguing that the case against the terrorist should be dropped completely as it was \u201ca farce of a trial\u201c. \u201cThere is no evidence at all against the three British men. The only evidence against them is these three confessions. We now have unequivocal proof that the confessions were obtained under duress and under torture. As there is no evidence against the men, the men need to be released straightaway and sent back to their families.\u201c This was despite the fact that Zacarias Moussaoui, who pleaded guilty to involvement in 9/11 and with Al Qaeda, told the\u00a0court: \u201dI, Moussaoui Zacarias, in the interests to preserve my life, enter with full conscience a plea of guilty, because I have knowledge and participated in Al Qaeda.\u201d Is this the record of a man who should be leading London?  Sadiq Khan was a human rights lawyer before he entered politics, and spent his time defending radical Islamists and self-confessed terrorists. He also defended\u00a0hate preacher Louis Farrakhan in 2002, arguing that the Nation of Islam leader should be allowed to enter the UK to embark on a propaganda tour. Bidding\u00a0to have the ban on Farrakhan\u00a0entering the UK\u00a0overturned \u2013 a ban that had been upheld by successive Home Secretaries since 1986 \u2013 Khan told the BBC: \u201cHe is preaching a message of self-discipline, self-reliance, atonement and responsibility\u2026.It\u2019s outrageous and astonishing that the British Government is trying to exclude this man.\u201d Louis Farrakhan, according to the BBC; \u2018was (a) man who had described Judaism as \u201ca gutter religion\u201d, characterised Christianity as an oppressive faith linked to the slavery of black people and called Adolf Hitler \u201cgreat\u201d. To any liberal who says \u201cSadiq Khan was just doing his job!\u201d ask them if they would say the same if Jeff Sessions was defending the KKK in Alabama (instead of prosecuting them like in reality). If he was an aggressive Klan defense lawyer, would they still say \u201che was just doing his job\u201d? Of course not. Liberal hypocrisy runs deep. Sadiq Khan is now attempting to have President Trump barred from entering the UK, arguing that his \u201cpolicies go against everything we stand for\u201c, however rolling protests against the mayor and his pathetic response to the terror attack in London on the weekend suggest Londoners are waking up to the truth about their \u201cliberal Muslim\u201d mayor.
