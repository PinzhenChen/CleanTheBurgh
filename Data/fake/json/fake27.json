{"text": " BOSTON, Massachusetts \u2013\u00c2 A 28-year-old Boston man, who doctors call Mr. Fidgets, was hospitalized today for emergency surgery after the emergency room attending physician\u00c2\u00a0discovered a fidget spinner lodged in Mr. Fidget\u2019s rectum \u2013 the 37th time they\u2019ve treated him for the same incident. \u201cWhen he came in the first time, we kind of laughed about it,\u201d said Dr. Mario Lambert of Boston Medical Center. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t really explain how it happened and, frankly, we didn\u2019t ask too many questions. Then it happened again, about 2 weeks later. Again, we didn\u2019t really press. By the time it happened 14 and 15 times, well, we just stopped caring.\u201d Dr. Lambert says that he believes that Mr. Fidgets is trying to insert the toy, commonly used by children with ADHD, for sexual gratification, because he likes to have his partner insert it, then try to spin it while it\u2019s inside. \u201cI can\u2019t say that it would do a thing for me, but hey, to each their own,\u201d said Dr. Lambert. \u201cProblem is, this guy really needs some psychological help, but he hasn\u2019t broken any laws. He\u2019s an adult, and he pays his hospital bill in cash. I don\u2019t know who this guy is or what he does for a living, but I tell you \u2013 his kinks are off the charts.\u201d\n\n\n|Tweet\n|Like0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments comments comments Posted on May 28, 2017 by Bob The Empire News Potato Bob The Empire News Potato 0  | | 0 | | 0 Posted in Health/Fitness, Weird News Tagged Boston, fidget spinner, Rectum", "source": "empirenews.net", "title": "Man Hospitalized After Getting Fidget Spinner Lodged in His Rectum For 37th Time"}
