{"text": "WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014While social media rumors ran wild Wednesday about what President Donald Trump\u2019s accidentally tweeted word \u201ccovfefe\u201d meant, Pentagon officials hurriedly changed over hundred of lines of coding in the nuclear missile launch system to remove the word as one of the key passwords to launch a nuclear strike. \u201cWe\u2019re all just glad everyone thought it was an honest spelling error, or some kind of autocorrect fail,\u201d stated Secretary of Defense James Mattis. \u201cI recently said on Face the Nation that nothing keeps me awake at night. That was false. This very scenario\u00a0keeps me awake at night.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Twitter account keeps me awake at night,\u201d he added. Phones were reportedly ringing off the hook at Strategic Command in Omaha as the new code was relayed to the entire chain of command including all of America\u2019s ballistic missile silos and underwater nuclear-armed submarines. \u201cWe had to change out all the secret laminated code cards and everything,\u201d Mattis added. \u201cI just really hope he doesn\u2019t tweet out the new code,\u201d he said as he refreshed Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, praying the President had\u00a0not posted anything in the last few minutes.
