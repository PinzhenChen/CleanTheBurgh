{"text": "DAVE WEASEL ST. LOUIS, MO \u2013 A 20-year-old man is in stable condition Monday afternoon after the gun he was posing naked with accidentally discharged and shot off his penis. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had someone shoot off their own junk before,\u201d the police said in a statement. \u201cThere was a man who shot off his foot, a middle-schooler shot her guinea pig, and even a baby was able to shoot both his parents, but never someone\u2019s own junk.\u201d \u201cFirst I posed with this bad-ass look on my face,\u201d said the man in a falsetto voice. \u201cThen I thought the only thing girls like more than guns is men without shirts on, so I took my shirt off. To stand out from the rest of the shirtless gun-selfies, I decided to take my pants off because I read online that women like it when random guys send them pictures of their dick. I was trying to thrust my hips around and do the\u00a0helicopter like my peen is another gun, but then the gun shot off instead of the camera.\u201d Police dropped all endangerment charges in exchange for him not filing a complaint about them expressing relief he won\u2019t be able to reproduce.

When you THINK you\u2019ve heard everything. I am NOT sure how I feel about this. Personally MYSELF? I would feel like an \u201cIDIOT\u201d and 100 times worse knowing it was in the newspaper adding \u201cfalsetto\u201d will certainly net the pulitzer \u201cThis week on The Violence Channel:: an all-new \u201cOw, My Balls!\u201d\u201d Reblogged this on Song Lyrics Explained.

I hope all you guys do know that the story is not real at all. I mean look at the wording, and the suppose quotes made by police officers and medical personnel.  No police officer is going to say \u201cjunk\u201d in an interview.  No professional would talk like this to the press.  Although I am definitely sure there are men out there stupid enough to shoot off their own penis, the story is a fake. Your comment is redundant\nThis is a SATIRE website.\nRead the disclaimer. Lemme just whip this ou\u2013 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!! MY DICK!!! If he wanted to get circumcised, there are easier and better ways. Fakr ass bullshit story No, women do not like strange men\u2019s dick pic\u2019s!!! Dumbass! You know it was a man that came up with something that stupid.  For once and for all.  NO, women do not like or in any way want a strange, unknown guy to send her a picture of his ball, penis or ass.  It is not sexy or alluring, it just looks stupid.  The fact that a guy is so proud of his dick that he wants to make unrequited pictures of it and send it to unknown women just makes the guy look pathetic. 9.999% of the time what he\u2019s got isn\u2019t even a little bit better than what anyone else has and all it does is either creep the woman out or she laughs her ass off at it.  Please for all woman kind.  Just don\u2019t.  Stop it. You know it was a man that came up with something that stupid.  For once and for all.

Please for all woman kind.  Just don\u2019t.  Stop it. The Loraina quickie This is a HOAX.  It is not in any media source in St. Louis.  Only on commentary blogs can I find this. If anyone can\u2019t figure that out based on the police comments, they deserve to believe the story\u2026 Very correct!! Police would never use refetences, such as junk. Its not meant to be a hoax-but rather a parody. Get a clue Raccy. You all DO know this is satire, right\u2026? ROFL..THIS ONE GOT ME ROFLLMAO\u2026.ANY ONE THAT CAN SHOOT HIS DICK DESERVE THE BRUCE JENNER AWARD.ROFL.oh help me Lord\u2026ROFL. Congrats on trying to be funny but sounding like an ignorant troll. are you retarded? if it\u2019s satire it\u2019s supposed to be clever, amusing and original.  this is all too common; men are always shooting their dicks or other body parts off.  this is nothing new; ask any ER nurse. Aside from gun control, we need self control! Don\u2019t you mean \u201cselfie control\u201d ? I am glad to find out that this is a fake. Of course, no one has to take an iQ test to buy a gun, but   I would hate to find out there are people ,with guns ,that are this stupid.  Wait a minute, there are people like this with guns and we will soon read about them on Facebook. I worked as a nurse (LPN) in a desert community where guns are very common..and (wink) some of the things that I\u2019ve seen shot or shot off..should have made the news..many times and shoot \u201cjunk\u201d was not such a rare incident but usually a small caliber weapon or air rifles..not surprised !! There are probably people this stupid andI would argue that we are more at risk from them voting than owning guns. Reblogged this on worldofdonad's Blog. That sucks, but not for him any longer! BYE,..BYE,..LOVE!!!  hello prosthetics !! it\u2019s a fake story retards Satire, and not that well done either !   Though this was funny \u2026 \u201csaid the man in a falsetto voice.\u201d I\u2019m glad this man is removed from the gene pool. Your comment is idiotic.\nThis is a SATIRE website.\nRead the f-ing disclaimer.\nYou should be removed from the gene pool. People believe thing is real is enough to make me want shoot off my\u2026.well, maybe not. This story is fake, the photo is of Jules bahler. He was convicted of bank robbery in Michigan. Ok how stupid can you be and still able to purchase a weapon or as certain idiots demonstrate\u2026. a gun ????\nIf you can\u2019t tell a round is in the chamber AND your legally old enough to buy a weapon.  You deserve what happens when you pull the trigger. See my reply below. THE WEAPON IS AN AUTOMATIC EITHER SEMI OR FULLY. IT HAS A CLIP, AND EVERY CLIP IS LOADED. THERE MAY NOT BE A BULLET IN THE BREACH, BUT AS SOON AS YOU SQUEEZE THAT TRIGGER.  BANG!!!!! NOW IT\u2019S LOADED!!!!!!  THE BOY IS STUPIDER THAN A 10 GALLON BUCKET OF SHIT!!!!! find your caps lock and refer to them as \u201cmagazines\u201d. Nothing worse than someone acting like they know about guns on a fake article. *magazine, not clip.\n*breech, not breach.\nGo back to your video games now\u2026 If there\u2019s Nothing in the breech, how does it load the next bullet ? Wow your dumber than this turd if it he was real. what a dumb ass You do realize that this is totally made up and intended to be a joke don\u2019t you?\nBig clues are the remark about him answering in a falsetto voice, and the police not filing an endangerment charge in exchange for him not filing a complaint about the police making remarks that at least he can\u2019t reproduce now.\nIf you really think this is a real news article you\u2019re probably as dumb as the fictional character in the story. With all the accidental gun shot stories that\u2019s been on Facebook as well news regarding these guys who are so in love with their guns but somehow turn off their brains when having their hands on their guns , it really wouldn\u2019t surprise me So fake What bathroom will he use Heh What bathroom will he use???? Hahaaaa! LMAO.. no charges because he could have filed and sued them for saying crap\u2026.LMAO.. i woulda said Fk that.. arragin  me.. I\u2019m suing.. i shot my junk off.. i got nothing more to lose fkr\u2019s..lol wont be able to reproduce\u2026..thank god!!!!!
