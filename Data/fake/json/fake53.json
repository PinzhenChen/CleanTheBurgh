{"text": "The verdict, which fell just hours before the International Women\u2019s Day, is considered \u201chistoric\u201d by some experts and advocacy groups for women\u2019s rights. \u201cIt may seem too little, too late, but it is\u00a0truly a\u00a0milestone event for all women in the region,\u201d explains Jane Austin, visibly excited. \u201cFrom now on, women will be considered as members of the mammal class, whereas before women shared\u00a0the legal status of an object, similar to that of a home appliance,\u201d she admits. Jillian Birch, spokeswoman at Amnesty International, said she is optimistic about the future as women will no longer be considered as \u201csoulless objects\u201d but as fully fledged mammals The recent verdict could completely upset all laws currently enforced in Saudi Arabia believes Jillian Birch, spokeswoman at Amnesty International. \u201cThis verdict shows the incredible progress the women\u2019s rights movement has made in the past 50 years,\u201d she admitted in a press conference this morning. \u201cWomen are still far from being considered 100% human, but their condition will improve drastically with this decision,\u201d she firmly believes. The verdict, which fell like a ton of bricks on the Saudi state, has clearly not found unanimous support amongst religious authorities and the political elite, concede experts. \u201cIt could create significant turmoil in the current legal state of affairs and the judiciary system of Saudi Arabia,\u201d says political analyst specialized in the Middle East, Anthony Bochstein. \u201cIf before women had the same rights as a chair or a table and were seen more as individual property, they now have an equivalent status to certain animal species, and thus must receive, at the very least, feeding, watering and be conferred a minimum of attention and respect, which was not the case previously,\u201d he explains. According to the expert panel that ruled on the matter, women are still devoid of a soul but have been shown to possess qualities common to the mammal species, which would explain their ability to procreate and breastfeed, as well as why they are equipped with seven cervical vertebrae, a characteristic unique to the mammal species.
