{"text": "The\u00a0victims\u00a0are local poachers who were illegally\u00a0hunting for elephants\u00a0inside the boundaries\u00a0the national park,\u00a0when they were surprised by\u00a0a group of almost\u00a0twenty adult Southwest African lions, the same species as Cecil the Lion, who died a few kilometres from the site\u00a0in July 215. The felines\u2019 attack was so sudden and violent, that\u00a0five of the ten men\u00a0were killed, three severely injured and two were only lightly injured, while the animals were mostly unhurt. The survivors\u00a0abandoned their dead comrades on the site and hurried back to\u00a0a nearby\u00a0village for medical care, where they were rapidly arrested. Zimbabwe Republic Police Commissioner-General, Augustine Chihuri, told reporters that the\u00a0poachers were visibly terrified by their experience and he hopes this incident serves as a lesson to other poachers. \u201cThe\u00a0men\u00a0were visibly traumatized by the attack,\u201d said Commissioner-General Chihuri, \u201cand after seeing their injuries and the remains of their dead comrades, I can see why. These guys tough\u00a0criminals carrying ak-47s, but they were literally shred to pieces and devoured\u00a0by the lions. I have never seen an animal attack reach this level of violence, and I have seen\u00a0a lot!\u201d The Commissioner-General of Zimbabwe Republic Police, Augustine Chihuri, described the scene as \u201ca horrible blood bath\u201d, with many bones and bits of flesh scattered over hundreds of square metres. The surviving poachers will now face a wide\u00a0array of\u00a0criminal charges if they survive their injuries. The charges brought by prosecutors include\u00a0illegal-hunting, possession of illegal weapons and contravening the Parks and Wildlife Act. Their first appearance in court is expected to take place on April 4th, when they will be facing sentences of\u00a0up to 25 years in jail and fines of up to US$100 000.
