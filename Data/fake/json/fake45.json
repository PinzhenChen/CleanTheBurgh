{"text": "The controversial video that was taken down by YouTube only hours after it was uploaded showed top ISIS leader Amadh\u00a0Abu Makmud\u00a0Al-alwani threatening those who would decide to vote for Donald Trump and calling them \u201cinfidels\u201d and \u201cgoat f\u2014-ers\u201d. He also claimed that even if Hillary was a woman and a \u201ctwo face devil\u201d, had the \u201ccharm of a pig\u201d and was \u201ctreacherous as the snake\u201d, that the Democratic presidential hopeful was at least in league with the \u201callied countries of the Islamic state\u201d such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Al-alwani also warned all Muslims not to take his warnings lightly and that supporters of Trump would be severely punished on earth and in Jannah (afterlife). \u201cTrump is a dog, he is the scum of the earth. He boasts that he will take our oil and join Russia, Syria and the Shia Iranians against us in our holy fight\u201d he added, visibly angry. \u201cThis (dog-faced) scumbag must not reach Washington. Although it is a sin to put an inferior being such as a woman into a position of power, it is the true plan of Satan to divide the Muslims of America. It would be dirty\u00a0and danis (filthy) to vote for Trump,\u201d he explained. Amadh\u00a0Abu Makmud\u00a0Al-alwani has risen as a prominent ISIS leader figure since coalition forces carried out a \u201cprecision strike\u201d last August, successfully targeting Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, number two of the terrorist organization at the time.
